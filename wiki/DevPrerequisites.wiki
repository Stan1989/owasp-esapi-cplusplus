#summary Package prerequisites for SafeInt, Crypto++, and Boost
#labels Developer,Prerequisites,Crypto,SafeInt,Boost,Yum,Apt-get

= Introduction =

Some commands to get the prerequisites on the system. It assumes GCC/G++, binutils, and friends are already installed.

ESAPI uses Boost's base installation, regex, and test.

In addition, non-GNU system will need gmake, If using FreeBSD, issue 'pkg_add -r gmake', while OpenaBSD should enter 'pkg_add gmake'.

= Details =

== SafeInt ==

SafeInt3.hpp is included in the ESAPI project directory and located in <ESAPI directory>/deps. No action is needed.

== Crypto++ ==

<pre># Debian and friends
$ sudo apt-get install libcrypto++8 libcrypto++8-dbg libcrypto++-dev</pre>

<pre># Fedora and friends
> su -
# yum install cryptopp cryptopp-devel</pre>

<pre># FreeBSD
> su -
# pkg_add -r cryptopp</pre>

OpenBSD does not offer Crypto++. It must be installed from sources. See the Crypto++ website at http://www.cryptopp.com/; and http://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Linux.

== Boost ==

<pre># Debian and friends
$ sudo apt-get install libboost-dbg libboost-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-regex-dev</pre>

<pre># Fedora and friends
> su -
# yum install boost-devel</pre>

<pre># FreeBSD
> su -
# pkg_add -r boost-libs</pre>

<pre># OpenBSD
> su -
# pkg_add boost</pre>

== Grepping Package ==

Searching packages can be performed as follows (using boost as an example).

<pre># Debian and friends
$ apt-cache pkgnames | grep -i boost</pre>

<pre># Fedora and friends
> yum search boost | grep -i devel</pre>
